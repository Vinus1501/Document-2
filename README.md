# **Introduction**
-   EBS stands for Elastic Block Store
-Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) in AWS is like a virtual hard drive for your virtual computer (EC2 instance). It's a way to store your data in the cloud.

Think of it as a Virtual Hard Drive:
-When you create a virtual computer in AWS (an EC2 instance), you need a place to store your files and data. EBS is like a virtual hard drive that you can attach to your virtual computer.
-So, in simple words, EBS is like a flexible, virtual hard drive that you can attach to your virtual computer in AWS, and it helps you store and manage your data in the cloud.

-1. Block Storage: 
-EBS provides block-level storage volumes that you can attach to EC2 instances. These volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices, and you can install a file system on them as you would with a physical hard drive.
